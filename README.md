# Baby_monitaring_sytem
The baby monitoring system is a project that detects the sound of a baby crying. In this busy world, mothers often must juggle multiple tasks and may not always be beside the cradle when the baby is sleeping, which could lead to disturbances. Our baby monitoring system detects the baby's cry when it wakes up and automatically moves the cradle to help the baby fall back asleep. If the baby continues to cry, indicating a potential problem, the system sends a message to the mother, alerting her to attend to the baby. We use an Arduino Uno, sound sensor, Wi-Fi module, and servo motor.
